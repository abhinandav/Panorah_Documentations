# Get Familiar with the Architecture

Before diving into development, it's essential to understand the structure, components, and design philosophy behind the Panorah Framework. Panorah is built with the goal of simplifying ERP system development by offering a robust, flexible framework that integrates seamlessly with PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and Piccolo ORM. 

This section will guide you through the core concepts of Panorah, including:

- **Modular Design**: Panorah is organized into modular components, making it easy to manage and scale. Each module represents a specific business function or area, allowing developers to create independent, reusable parts.

- **Database Integration**: With PostgreSQL as its backbone, Panorah provides efficient database management for complex applications. The use of Piccolo ORM simplifies interactions with the database, allowing you to define and manage your data models effectively.

- **API-Centric Approach**: Built with FastAPI, Panorah follows an API-centric design, providing a streamlined method to build and manage RESTful APIs for seamless integration and high-performance communication.

- **Frontend and Mobile Compatibility**: Panorah supports development for web and mobile applications, enabling a cohesive experience across devices with libraries like React Native.

As you explore, familiarize yourself with the file structure, key components, and coding conventions used in Panorah. This knowledge will be essential as you begin to build and customize applications on the framework.
