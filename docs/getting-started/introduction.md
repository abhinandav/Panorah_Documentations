# Introduction
**Welcome to Panorah Framework Documentation**

Panorah is an ERP-like, full-stack web framework built with Python and powered by PostgreSQL. Designed to be versatile and efficient, Panorah provides a comprehensive foundation for creating enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications and other database-driven solutions. Similar to how Frappe supports ERPNext, Panorah enables developers to rapidly build, customize, and scale robust ERP systems tailored to various business needs.


### Getting Started
**Why Panorah**

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.


**Prerequisites**
Before you can start with Panorah, be sure you understand the stack it's built on.
