  "description": "The views.py file is a core component of the Panorah Framework, serving as the interface between the backend logic and external requests. It defines a series of controllers that handle a wide range of operations, offering modular, extensible, and type-safe API endpoints. Additionally, this module supports dynamic operations by leveraging controllers to process and manage requests efficiently.",
